# Hector Cube

Hector my beloved

Made with [threejs](https://threejs.org/) + [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)



## Development Environment

Should be as simple as:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:TheTeaCat/hectorcube.git
cd hectorcube
npm install
npm run watch
```



## Production Deployment

I'm using Cloudflare pages. It runs `npm run build` and publishes the `dist` directory.
